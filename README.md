# Hello world
<sup>Connect with me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acheong08/) to support my projects. I'm graduating high school soon and knowing some people might help my chances at finding employment.</sup>

## About me
I'm a high school student from Malaysia, currently studying in China, and going to the UK in a few months. I'm enrolled in the IBDP curriculum and on my second year. 

## Projects
I have some scattered random projects I do based on whatever interests me at the moment. I am generally interesed in AI because I'm lazy and would rather have my work done for me.

I'm not the best programmer but I make up for it with the speed at which I am able to learn new technologies. Throw any project at me and I am able to learn the required stack within a week.

## Tech stack
Anything goes. My learning is project based.

What I have existing experience with:
- [Wails framework](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) -- GUI
- [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) -- Reactive websites
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) -- CSS
- [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) -- Web framework
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) -- Web server
- Firefox extensions

Languages:
- Go
- Python
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Bash

<sup>I can also use Java but I would rather not</sup>

Other random stuff:
- Linux (advanced command line)
- Nginx & Certbot
- Reverse engineering (APIs/Software/etc)
- Bug bounties (Apple ecosystem)
